		<h1>Earth Day Awareness in the Home and Beyond (by Bathroom Remodel.com)</h1>	
				
		<p>&nbsp;<br />
A healthy and clean environment is important when it comes to one&#8217;s health and the health of family and friends. This is why Earth Day is so important to everyone no matter where they live. Although the Earth provides the things that are needed for most people to live comfortably right now, a lot of the natural resources that people rely on are limited or in danger and may not be around in the future. That&#8217;s because the environment is affected by the things that people do every day &#8211; from the garbage that is thrown away to extra long showers and riding in cars. The damage to the Earth has gone on for a long time, and before Earth Day first started most people didn&#8217;t think much about the environment at all. That&#8217;s one of the reasons that it was created. On Earth Day, kids and adults from all over the world learn about new ways to protect the world that they live in and participate in activities that are environmentally friendly. A person doesn&#8217;t have to wait until Earth Day, however, to take action and become environmentally friendly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Earth Day was created in response to uncontrolled pollution and a lack of government intervention. Prior to its creation it was normal for businesses to legally dump toxic waste into rivers and streams and participate in other environmentally harmful activities. To bring national focus on the problem and also force the government to take action, a Senator from Wisconsin by the name of Gaylord Nelson created Earth Day. It was first recognized in 1970 when students at colleges and universities took place in rallies and protests. As a result the Environmental Protection Agency, which people call the EPA, was formed later that same year. The EPA was created to handle issues that involve the environment to ensure its protection.</p>

<h2>Waste Conservation</h2>
<p>Waste conservation involves reducing the amount of garbage that ends up in landfills. Kids can do their part by helping their parents when it comes to recycling items that are made of plastic and aluminum, and they can also make extra money. Often plastic bottles and aluminum cans can be taken to a recycling center for cash. Newspaper, cardboard, and other paper products should also be recycled and not thrown away. Other items around the house that should be recycled and never thrown out in the trash include batteries, electronics, tires, and motor oil. Another way to recycle is to compost. Composting turns food, leaves and other organic materials including paper, into a dirt-like substance that is used to make soil healthier and richer. It is a simple project that kids can participate in. It can be done indoors or outdoors. One method, called vermicomposting, even uses worms. Recycling isn&#8217;t the only way that kids can help reduce waste. Finding creative uses for items instead of throwing them away is great way to reuse items that would normally be thrown away. For example, the unused side of paper can be saved and used as a create a scratch pad. People may also conserve waste by reducing how much they use.</p>

<h2>Energy Conservation</h2>
<p>Reducing the amount of electricity that is used on a daily basis is another way to protect the Earth. By saving energy people are reducing the amount of stress that is being put on the Earth&#8217;s natural resources. Some people help reduce the stress by using the energy of the sun to help with their energy needs. They do this by adding solar panels to their home, which convert sunlight to energy that is used as electricity. Everyone can help reduce energy usage by making small changes in their day-to-day habits. Turning off lights, using energy-saving light bulbs, and shutting off gaming consoles and televisions when not in use, are just some of the things that kids and their families can do. Televisions, computers and other electronics still use energy when they are turned off. To save the most energy, these items should be unplugged from the outlet. Most often parents set programmable thermostats at home. Asking parents to set the thermostat to 78 degrees in the summer and 68 degrees in the winter will help reduce energy and will reduce the cost of heating and cooling the house.</p>

<h2>Water Conservation</h2>
<p>Most people believe that there is so much water on the Earth that they don&#8217;t think about the need to conserve it. But, of all of the water that covers the planet, only one percent of it can be used for drinking, watering plants, or even washing. Changes in the environment also affect how much it rains. When it rains less the less water is available for use and the need to conserve is even greater. If water conservation becomes a habit, the less strain there is on the existing water supply. Things that kids and adults can do to save water includes taking shorter showers, turning off the water while brushing their teeth, and using the dishwasher and washing machine only when they are full. Adults should replace standard toilets and shower-heads with ones that conserve water. Toilets should be ultra-low flush and shower-heads should be water-saving. Outdoors people can save water by not over-watering their lawns, gardens, and flowers, and avoid watering on rainy days. When washing a bicycle or car use a bucket instead of a hose to reduce the amount of water that is used.</p>

<h2>Preventing Pollution</h2>
<p>Reducing energy usage is one of the most effective ways to prevent pollution. Most energy produced by burning fossil fuels that release a greenhouse gas called carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases affect the environment in a bad way and they help cause global warming. People can also help fight pollution by riding in cars less. Cars also release carbon dioxide and are bad for the air. Walking, biking or even riding public transportation to school, the mall, or to visit friends can help. Recycling also helps to prevent air pollution because it requires less energy to recycle an item that it does to make more that are new. Indoor air can also become polluted. It can become more polluted than the air that is outside. Opening windows and letting in fresh air can help reduce indoor pollution. Reducing the amount of chemicals that are used indoors will also help reduce the amount of pollution. When a family member smokes, he or she is polluting the air and should smoke only outdoors. To avoid polluting the water, avoid over-watering lawns. When a lawn is over-watered, the excess water makes its way into storm drains. This water often carries chemicals such as fertilizer or pesticides from the lawn that will eventually make its way back into rivers and the ocean. Protect water and the fish that live in it by not dumping anything in a storm drain. Recycling motor oil also helps prevent pollution of water sources.</p>

<h2>Plant a Tree/Flower</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.treeremoval.com/plant-a-tree-and-celebrate-earth-day/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.treeremoval.com']);">Planting a tree is a great way to celebrate Earth Day</a> (Thanks <a href="http://www.treeremoval.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.treeremoval.com']);">TreeRemoval.com</a>); in fact, it is one of the most popular activities on this day. The positive impact of trees on the environment is the primary reason for this popularity. Trees benefit the Earth and the people and animals that live on it by filtering out pollution, preventing the loss of soil, assisting in the recycling of water, and providing shade. Trees help feed animals, and provide them with shelter. Trees are often cut down however for a number of reasons, such as making room for new buildings, roads, and homes. If unable to plant a tree, consider planting flowers that also help support the environment.</p>
